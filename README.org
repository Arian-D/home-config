#+TITLE: Home Config (WIP)
* Usage
I still haven't learned how to include the channels in the reconfigure
process, so first
** Move Channels
,you'd have to move the [[./channels.scm]] file to
=~/.guix-home/=:
#+begin_src bash
  cp ./channels.scm ~/.guix-home/channels.scm 
#+end_src
And then,
** Reconfigure
#+begin_src bash
  guix home reconfigure home-configuration.scm 
#+end_src
